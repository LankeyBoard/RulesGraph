# Building a New Character

slug: BUILDING-A-PC

ruleType: RULE\
Your GM should tell you the level you are starting at. If you are starting higher than first level, follow the rules for leveling up after building your character at first level.\
Pick a Lineage, Culture and Class.\
Assign stats - You have a set of 3,2,0,-2. Use each number once, placing them in your 4 stats. Then add your stat bonuses from your Lineage and your Culture. These cannot both go to the same Stat.\
Higher numbers are better. Your class will have at least 1 primary stat. It's a good idea to have that be your highest number.\
Pick a [Novice Feature](/rules/generic_features/novice_features).\
(Optional) Write a backstory for your character.

## Leveling Up

slug: LEVELING-UP

ruleType: RULE\

# Character Resources

slug: CHAR-RESOURCES

ruleType: RULE\

## Stamina

slug: STAMINA

ruleType: RULE\
Stamina is the characters wellspring of energy. It is relatively quick to go down, and easy to get back. The exact amount of Stamina a character has is determined by their Class and stat block. Stamina can be used for Class abilities and to avoid taking damage. See [Exhausted, Dying, Last Stand & Healing](/rules/player_rules#EDL) for what happens at 0 Stamina.

## Health

slug: HEALTH

ruleType: RULE\
Health represents the life force of your character. It is slow to get back and in limited supply. See [Exhausted, Dying, Last Stand & Healing](/rules/player_rules#EDL) for what happens at 0 Health.

## Resting

slug: REST

ruleType: RULE\
If you spend Stamina or engage in strenuous activities while resting, the rest ends immediately and you gain no benefits from it.

### Catch Your Breath

slug: CATCH-YOUR-BREATH

ruleType: RULE\
When you have a moment, you can Catch Your Breath, tending to your wounds, wiping down your weapons, and centering yourself. To Catch Your Breath, spend 10 minutes resting and performing light activities.\
At the end of the rest, you regain all missing Stamina.\
If you are at 0 Health, you gain 1 Health. Some classes may also have features that refresh when you Catch Your Breath.

### A Night's Rest

slug: NIGHTS-REST

ruleType: RULE\
A good Night's Rest is still important to an adventurer. To complete a night's rest, spend a minimum of 6 hours sleeping. This gives surface level wounds a chance to heal and prepare yourself for the next day. When you finish a Night's Rest, return your Stamina to full, and gain Fortune's Favor. If you are above half Health, return to full Health. If you are at or below half Health, return to half Health.\
If you are awake for more than 24 hours in a row, Test your Mettle each hour. The difficulty of this test increases by 1 for each hour beyond 24 hours. Pass (15+): You suffer no ill effects. Mixed (10-14): Reduce your current and maximum stamina by 3. Fail (9-): Reduce your current and maximum stamina by 10. If you are reduced to 0 stamina in this way you become unconscious. You must complete a Night's Rest to remove these effects.

### Rest and Relax

To gain the benefits of Resting and Relaxing (R&R) you must spend 5 nights in a safe and relatively comfortable shelter while only engaging in light activity. Eg. At home or in an inn. Or spend 14 days & nights in less than ideal conditions with no more than light activity. Eg. Sleeping in a tent in the woods.\
After successful Rest and Relaxation, regain all lost Health and Stamina. You also lose any conditions that do not specifically last through a R&R

# Tests

slug: TESTS

ruleType: RULE\
Tests are how you determine the outcome of uncertain events, can you smash open a door (Mettle), talk a guard into looking the other way (Heart), dodging a tomato hurled at your head (Agility).\
First the Success and Failure points of the test are set by the GM (Game Master) and the general outcome of success and failure are announced if it is reasonable for the player characters to know them. The player then rolls 1d20 and adds any relevant bonuses to the result. If the result is at least equal to the Success point, they pass the test and have a beneficial outcome. If the result is greater than or equal to the Failure point but worse than the Success, then the result is Mixed. The GM can offer Success with a Cost or Mixed Success on a Mixed result. If the results are less than the Failure point, the result is a failure. In general the Failure point is five less than the Success point.

## Success

slug: SUCCESS

ruleType: RULE\
Success on a test doesn't always mean getting exactly what you want, but it does mean a favorable outcome for you. To achieve Success, you have to roll at least the Success point for the Test.\
Eg: You are talking to the innkeeper negotiating for a room. The GM calls for a Heart Test and tells you that you'll succeed on a 15, earning your party a good discount. Failure is a 5 and you get no discount and an undesirable room. You roll a 13 and add +2 for your Heart to get a total of 15, which means you succeed. You manage to negotiate a 20% discount!

## Success With a Cost

slug: SUCCESS-WITH-COST

ruleType: RULE\
Success with a Cost is one possible Mixed Result where the GM offers a consequence and the player chooses if they want to accept the consequences or fail the test.\
Eg: You try and scale a difficult cliff, you roll a mixed result. The GM may offer that you try and fall the first time, taking 1d6 damage but make it up on the second try or you fail and realize it would be too risky to climb and can't make it up.

## Mixed Success

slug: MIXED-SUCCESS

ruleType: RULE\
A Mixed Ssuccess is another possible Mixed Result when you are partially successful in your endeavor. You achieve some of the outcome you want, but there are some complications or downsides.\
Eg: You are trying to trick a guard into letting you go after being caught breaking curfew. You told him you forgot your pass at home and got a Mixed Success on the Heart Test your GM called for. The guard believes you but insists on escorting you home to show him the pass.

## Failure

slug: FAILURE

ruleType: RULE\
A Failure occurs when you cannot achieve your desired outcome. This may mean the situation was harder than you initially believed or because you couldn't do it as well as you hoped or any other reason you and the GM think is reasonable. Sometimes the consequences of failure are direct, such as taking damage, other times they can simply be a complication for the story, this is determined by the GM.\
When you roll a Failure, you gain [Fortune's Favor](/rules/player_rules#FORTUNES-FAVOR)\
Eg: You are scaling a castle wall, trying to get in without alerting the goblins keeping watch from the nearby tower. Your GM calls for an Agility Test, where Success is a 15 and means you get up without being noticed and a Failure is a 10 and means you get spotted. You roll your Agility Test, you get a 5 on the dice and add 2 from your Agility, giving you a total of 7. The goblins spot you half way up, they begin to shout something you can't understand and begin to run towards the wall you are climbing!

## Contests

slug: CONTESTS

ruleType: RULE\
When two or more characters are directly challenging each other the GM might call for a contested roll. A Contest is like any other test except the difficulty is set by comparing the competing dice. If one side is more than 5 higher than the other, then that side Succeeds on the Test and the other side Fails. If both sides are within 5, then the result is Mixed.\
Eg: You joined an arm wrestling competition. Your first competition you are against a stout dwarven woman. The GM calls for a Test of Mettle. You roll a 13 and add your Mettle of 3 or a total of 16. The GM rolls a 10 and adds the woman's Mettle of 2, giving them a result of 12. This makes it a Mixed Success so the GM narrates how you go back and forth, finally winning the best 2-3 rounds on the 3rd round.

## Group Tests

slug: GROUP-TESTS

ruleType: RULE\
Sometimes a group of characters are performing an action where the success depends on the group's overall performance, not one individual. One common case is sneaking around a dungeon. When taking a Group Test, each character rolls against the Test, counting the number of Success, Mixed, and Failures. The average of the result is the group's result. An easy way to find the average is to subtract the larger of successes or failures from the other. If that new number is higher than the Mixed, that's the result, otherwise the result is Mixed.\
Eg: The GM calls for a Group Test for a group of 5, Pass is 13 and Fail is 8. If the group rolls 2 Passes, 2 Mixed and 1 Fail, then we subtract the 1 Fail from 2 Passes, leaving us with 1 Pass and 2 Mixed, so the result is Mixed. If instead there were 3 Passes and 1 Mixed, the result would have been a Pass.

## Helping on a Test

slug: HELP

ruleType: RULE\
If a character is taking a Test and others are providing aid, if the character is not already rolling with Fortune's Favor, they can roll with Fortune's Favor. Otherwise add a +3 to the result of the test. No matter how many people are helping, you can only gain each bonus once.\
Eg: Bill the Brawler is trying to open a big heavy stone door. His party is helping him by giving him a crowbar and helping to pull on the door. If Bill is not already using Fortune's Favor on this roll, he gets Fortune's Favor and adds +3 to the roll because there are two different ways the party is helping him.

## Luck Test

slug: LUCK-TEST

A Luck Test is a special kind of Test without any Stat attached and cannot be helped on. It's just a Test to see if the player is lucky.\
Eg: Smee the Shapeshifter wants to know what the smartest animals are around to communicate with. They aren't willing to track or spend time looking around for a smart animal so this wouldn't be a Test of their Heart or Intellect, instead it will be a Test of Luck.

## 1s and 20s

slug: 1-20

ruleType: RULE\

### 1 - Critical Failure

slug: 1s

ruleType: RULE\
Rolling a 1 is the worst a character could do. Tests always fail.

### 20 - Critical Success

slug: 20s

ruleType: RULE\
Rolling a 20 is the best a character could do. Tests always pass and when you roll a Critical Success on an attack, you deal double damage on the attack.

## Fortune's Favor

slug: FORTUNES-FAVOR

ruleType: RULE\
When you Fail a Test, you gain Fortune's Favor.\
With Fortune's Favor, when you take a Test, before you roll any dice, you can spend your Fortune's Favor to roll a second d20. You can use the results of either dice.

## Misfortune

slug: MISFORTUNE

ruleType: RULE\
Circumstances may cause misfortune as well. When the GM calls for a roll with Misfortune, you roll a second d20 and take the lower of the two rolls. If you have Fortune's Favor, before you roll you can chose to give it up to cancel out the Misfortune and roll the test normally.

# Combat

slug: COMBAT

ruleType: RULE\
Each round of combat is split into 3 parts, 1st, Environmental effects, 2nd, Players take their turn, 3rd, Enemies take their turn. During the player's turn, each player makes one Action and can move up to their speed. During the enemies turn enemies with actions can take one action and move. Enemies with only counters can only move unless they are not engaged, in which case they can use a counter as an action.

## Exchanges

slug: EXCHANGES

ruleType: RULE\
When a character attacks or casts an offensive spell at another creature or creatures an exchange begins. To start the exchange, Test your Attack, adding your Base Attack Bonus. The defenders Armor and Counter become the Success and Failure points of the Test. If you Succeed on the Test then the hit is clean and there is no room for retaliation. If the result is Mixed then you Clash. You can either choose to deal no damage or strike but leave yourself open to counter attack. Your Attack is resolved first, and then the target can use one of their Counter Actions. If you Fail the Test, your Attack is countered, with no effect and the target can use one of their counter moves.

### AOE Exchanges

slug: AOE-EXCHANGES

ruleType: RULE\
When your Attack targets multiple enemies, roll a single Attack Test, and compare to each enemy's defenses. If the roll would be a Clash or Counter, the GM chooses which creature will get to take a Counter Action.

### Engaging an Enemy

slug: ENGAGING-ENEMIES

ruleType: RULE\
When you attempt to attack an enemy, they are [Engaged](/rules/player_rules#ENGAGED). Engaged Minions cannot take an Action on their turn, Non-boss monsters damage dice go down by 1 step, and bosses lose access to their most potent abilities.

Bits: Something that costs Bits isn't expensive enough to be worth worrying about.\
Whether something is worth Coin or Bits comes down to the GMs discretion. Generally something that is going to help the player or they should feel the cost should cost Coin. But something that's just flavor, or part of normal everyday life should be Bits. Grabbing a bite to eat and some drinks with the party at the local inn. That costs Bits. Buying a round and plying a patron for information. That's going to cost a Coin or Two. A dress to get you into the royal ball. That's going to be more Coin.
