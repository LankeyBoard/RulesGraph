Pick a Lineage, Culture and Class.\
Assign stats - You have a set of 3,2,0,-2. Use each number once, placing them in your 4 stats.\
Higher numbers are better. Your class will have at least 1 primary stat. It's a good idea to have that be your highest number.\

# Character Resources

## Stamina
slug: STAMINA

Each character has a pool of stamina. The exact amount is determined by their class or stat block if they are an NPC. Your stamina can be used for class abilities as well as to enhance certain generic tests such as jumping and marching. You can also opt to have damage cost stamina instead of health.

## Health
slug: HEALTH

Health represents the life force of your character. See Exhausted, Dying, Last Stand & Healing for what happens at 0 Health 

## Resting
slug: REST

If you spend stamina while resting, it immediately ends the rest and you gain no benefits from the rest
### Catch Your Breath
slug: CATCH-YOUR-BREATH

When you have a moment, you can catch your breath, tending to your wounds, wiping down your weapons, and centering yourself. To Catch Your Breath, spend 10 minutes resting and performing light activities without interruption.
At the end of the rest, you regain all missing stamina.
If you are at 0 Health, you gain 1 Health. Some classes may also have features that refresh when you Catch Your Breath.

### Rest and Relax
slug: REST-RELAX

In-between adventures you have a chance to rest, relax and prepare yourself for the next call to action. To gain the benefits of Resting and Relaxing (R&R) you must spend 5 nights in a safe and relatively comfortable shelter while only engaging in light activity. Eg. At home or in an inn. Or spend 14 days & nights in less than ideal conditions with no more than light activity. Eg. Sleeping in a tent in the woods.\
After successful Rest and Relaxation, regain all lost Health and Stamina. You also lose any conditions that do not specifically last through a R&R

### A Night's Sleep
slug: NIGHTS-SLEEP

A good night's rest is still important to an adventurer. If you are awake for more than 24 hours in a row, Test your Mettle each hour. The difficulty of this test increases by 1 for each hour beyond 24 hours. Pass (15+): You suffer no ill effects. Mixed (10-14): Reduce your current and maximum stamina by 3. Fail (9-): Reduce your current and maximum stamina by 10. If you are reduced to 0 stamina in this way you become unconscious. Once you sleep for at least 6 hours you lose any negative effects from a lack of rest  and reset the difficulty of the test.



# Tests
slug: TESTS

Tests are how you determine the outcome of uncertain events, can you smash open a door (Mettle), talk a guard into looking the other way (Heart), dodging a tomato hurled at your head (Agility).
First the success and failure points of the test is set by the GM (Game Master) and the general outcome of success and failure are announced if it is reasonable for the player characters to know. Then players can decide if they want to attempt the test. The player then rolls 1d20 and adds their stat bonus to the result. If the result is at least equal to the success point, they pass the test and have a beneficial outcome. If the result is greater than or equal to the failure point but worse than the success, then the result is mixed. The GM can offer success with a cost or mixed success. If the results are less than the failure pint, the result is a failure. In general the failure point is five less than the success point.
## Success
slug: SUCCESS

Success on a test doesn't always mean getting exactly what you want, but it does mean a favorable outcome for you. You roll at least the  difficulty for the test.\
Eg: You are talking to the innkeeper negotiating for a room. The GM calls for a heart test and tells you success needs a 15, and you'll get a good discount. Failure is a 5 and you get no discount and an undesirable room. You roll a 13 and add +2 for your heart to get a total of 15, which means you succeed. You manage to negotiate a 20% discount!

## Success With a Cost
slug: SUSSESS-WITH-COST

Success with a cost is when the GM offers a consequence and the player chooses if they want to accept the consequences or fail the test.\
Eg: You try and scale a difficult cliff, you roll a mixed result. The GM may offer that you try and fall the first time, taking 1d6 damage but make it up on the second try or you fail and realize it would be too risky to climb and can't make it up.

## Mixed Success
slug: MIXED-SUCCESS

A mixed success is when you are partially successful in your endeavor. You achieve some of the outcome you want, but there are some complications or downsides.\
Eg: You are trying to trick a guard into letting you go after being caught breaking curfew. You told him you forgot your pass at home and get a mixed success on the Heart test your GM called for. The guard believes you but insists on escorting you home to show him the pass.

## Failure
slug: FAILURE

A failure occurs when you cannot achieve your desired outcome. This may mean the situation was harder than you initially believed or because you couldn't do it as well as you hoped or any other reason you and the GM think is reasonable. Sometimes the consequences of failure are direct, such as taking damage, other times they can simply be a complication for the story, this is determined by the GM.\
Eg: You are scaling a castle wall, trying to get in without alerting the goblins keeping watch from the nearby tower. Your GM calls for an agility test, where success is a 15 and means you get up without being noticed and a failure is a 10 and means you get spotted. You roll your agility test, you get a 5 on the dice and add 2 from your agility, giving you a total of 7. The goblins spot you half way up, they begin to shout something you can't understand and begin to run towards the wall you are climbing!

## Contests
slug: CONTESTS

When two or more characters are directly challenging each other the GM might call for a contested roll. A Contest is like any other test except the difficulty is set by comparing the competing dice. If one side is more than 5 higher than the other, then that side passes the test and the other side fails. If both sides are within 5, then the result is a Mixed Success.\
Eg: You joined an arm wrestling competition. Your first competition you are against a stout dwarven woman. The GM calls for a Test of Mettle. You roll a 13 and add your Mettle of 3 or a total of 16. The GM rolls a 10 and adds the woman's Mettle of 2, giving them a result of 12. This makes it a Mixed Success so the GM narrates how you go back and forth, finally winning the best 2-3 rounds on the 3rd round.

## Group Tests
slug: GROUPT-TESTS

Sometimes a group of characters are performing an action where the success depends on the groups overall performance, not one individuals. One common case is sneaking around a dungeon. When taking a group Test, each character rolls against the test, count the number of Success, Mixed, and Failures. The average of the result is the groups result. An easy way to find the average is to subtract the larger of successes or failures from the other. If that new number is higher than the Mixed, that's the result, otherwise the result is Mixed.\
Eg: The GM calls for a Group Test for a group of 5, Pass is 13 and Fail is 8. If the group rolls 2 Passes, 2 Mixed and 1 Fail, then we subtract the 1 Fail from 2 Passes, leaving us with 1 Pass and 2 Mixed, so the result is Mixed. If instead there were 3 Passes and 1 Mixed, the result would have been a Pass.

## 1s and 20s
slug: 1-20


### 1 - Critical Failure
slug: 1s

Rolling a 1 is the worst a character could do. Tests always fail.

### 20 - Critical Success
slug: 20s

Rolling a 20 is the best a character could do. Tests always pass and when you roll a critical success on an attack, you  deal double damage on the attack.


## Fortune's Favor
slug: FORTUNES-FAVOR

When you fail a test, you gain Fortune's Favor.\
With Fortune's Favor, if you take a Test, you can spend your Fortune's Favor to roll a second d20. You can use the results of either dice.

## Misfortune
slug: MISFORTUNE

Circumstances may cause misfortune as well. When the GM calls for a roll with Misfortune, you roll a second d20 and take the lower of the two rolls. If you have Fortunes Favor, before you roll you can chose to give it up to cancel out the Misfortune and roll the test normally.


# Combat
slug: COMBAT

Each round of combat is split into 3 parts, 1st, Environmental effects, 2nd Players turn, 3rd Enemies turn. During the players turn, each player makes one action and can move up to their movement speed. During the enemies turn enemies with actions can take one action and move. Enemies with only counters can only move unless they have not been attacked, in which case they can use a counter as an action.
## Exchanges
slug: EXCHANGES

When a character attacks or casts an offensive spell at another creature or creatures an exchange begins. To start the exchange, make an attack roll and add the relevant stats depending on your class. Compare the total attack to the creatures Defense and Counter. If you roll above their Defense then the hit is clean and there is no room for retaliation. If the roll is between their Defense and Counter then you clash. You can either choose to deal no damage or strike but leave yourself open to counter attack. Your attack is resolved first, and then the target can use one of their counter moves. If you roll below their Counter, your attack is countered and the target can use one of their counter moves.
### AOE Exchanges
slug: AOE-EXCHANGES

When your action targets multiple enemies, roll a single attack test, and compare to each enemies defenses. If any target clashes or counters, the GM chooses which creature will take advantage of the opening. If two or more enemies clash or counter, the creature makes the attack with Fortune's Favor. Only a single enemy can clash or counter a single exchange.

Buying a round and plying a patron for information. That's going to cost a Coin or Two. A dress to get you into the royal ball. That's going to be more Coin.
