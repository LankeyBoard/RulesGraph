# Intro

## General Philosophy

- Provide information whenever possible
  - If the character would know the general difficulty of the task they are undertaking, the player should know the difficulty of the Test and the general consequences of failure.
  - Don't roll for "Perception" unless both outcomes are interesting or the failure is quickly revealed.
- The characters are competent and familiar with the world even if the players are not.
