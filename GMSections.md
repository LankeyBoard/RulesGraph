# General Philosophy of Fortune's Favor

SLUG: GM-PHILOSOPHY

- Provide information whenever possible
- If the character would know the general difficulty of the task they are undertaking, the player should know the difficulty of the Test and the general consequences of failure.
- Don't roll for "Perception" unless both outcomes are interesting or the failure is quickly revealed.
- The characters are competent and familiar with the world even if the players are not.

For more information [The Ultimate Session 0 Checklist](https://www.level1geek.com/blog/dnd-session-0) by Level 1 Geek is a good place to start.

## Making Enemies

SLUG: GM-MAKING-ENEMIES

Three types of enemies, minions: easy to kill canon fodder, monsters: a reasonable challenge. bosses: a tough challenge. Every boss should provide a unique challenge.

### Building Encounters

SLUG: GM-BUILDING-ENCOUNTERS

An encounter encompasses everything that happens between opportunities for PCs to Catch Your Breath.

For each character on the Player's side, there should be 1 Monster of the same level. 2 Minions can be used in place of 1 Monster, or 1 Boss can be used in place of 2 Monsters.
These stat's assume 5 encounters per Rest & Recuperation. If you have less encounters, you will need to add either more enemies or increase the damage of the enemies.
